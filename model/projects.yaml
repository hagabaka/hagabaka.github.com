    A web application which displays and calculates information about items from a game
  story: |
    "Idol" is a new feature of the MMORPG [Dofus](http://www.dofus.com/){:target=external},
    involving hundreds of items and a scoring system. I built this application to help
    players understand the system, and refined its features based on player feedback.

    To speed up the development process, I created scripts which crawled the game website to
    acquire images and text descriptions of the hundreds of items displayed in the application.
    I utilized latest web technologies to enable the application to perform intensive
    computations in the background while allowing the user to interact with the page without
    delays.

    [Simple Desktop Display Manager (SDDM)](http://github.com/sddm/sddm){:target:external} is a
    system software used by some Linux users. To configure it, a user had to manually edit text
    configuration files. I created this application which presents the settings in a user-
    friendly graphical interface.

    I announced this application to Linux desktop environment developers, some of whom
    have adopted it into their systems. I also responded to bug reports and feature requests
    from users.

  name: Dofus Dimensional Portals
  description: A web application which displays periodically updated information
  story: |
    The MMORPG [Dofus](http://www.dofus.com/){:target=external}' features "portals" which
    change location in the game and must be found by players. Some players started sharing
    these locations on a web forum. I created this application which periodically scans
    the forum, and displays the latest found locations.

    To improve utility of the application, I fine-tuned the text processing code so that it
    understood people's postings which were in a variety of formats and styles. I implemented
    a push-notification mechanism so that the page updates without requiring the user to reload
    manually. Currently about 60 unique visitors use this application per day.

  type: web appliction
  story: |
    Treasure hunt is a feature of the MMORPG [Dofus](http://www.dofus.com/){:target=external}'
    where players follow text clues to find items at specific in-game locations. Some players
    shared the clues with screenshots of the items to help those who didn't understand the
    clues, including some foreign language players, on a web forum. The forum thread eventually
    grew too long to navigate, so I created this application to display the clues and
    screenshots on a single page, with the capabilities to search, sort, and filter them.

    I set up a content delivery network and implemented other features to make sure that this
    image-heavy web page stays fast and stable. Currently about 200 unique visitors per day use
    this application.

  collaboration: true
  story: |
    [Frogatto and Friends](http://www.frogatto.com/) is a PC and iOS video game developed by
    Lost Pixels. It was capable of displaying dialog and user interface text in different
    languages, but since the game uses hand-drawn letters, it was not feasible to include
    translations in Chinese or Japanese, languages that have tens of thousands of characters.
    I developed scripts to find the set of characters used in the game translation and
    automatically build a sprite sheet compatible with the game, solving this problem.

    In addition, I collaborated with Chinese and Japanese translators to improve the game's
    translations, and made improvements to the game's Linux building process.
