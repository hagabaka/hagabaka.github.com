This is my portfolio. The published site is at http://hagabaka.github.io/. It lists my projects, along with my skills and the technologies I used in them.

While it is still an early work-in-progress, I appreciate any feedback, and you are welcome to reuse the code.

Todo:
* [ ] Add screenshots
* [ ] Add "about me"
* [ ] Add contact information
* [ ] Improve user interaction and appearance
